Hey everyone! Hope you're doing well.
Recently I did my FrontEnd Development Course online and wanted to practice the things I learned. So I created a mini and beginner level project named "QR Code Generator" using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In this project I made a box in which I added a simple text, a input text type box and a button.
In the button I also learned how to add a simple hover effect.
I also gave some animations to the input box like I have given the shake animation to input box. So whenever someones click on the button without entering anything in the input box, it will show this animantion.
I then used a website to get my QR Code and then linked it with the HTML by using JavaScript.
I used A very basic level JavaScript in thi project.
